# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Challenge
### Data
#### Table 1



#### Table 2



### Technical Analysis
Bobby’s manager would like to know how many roles will need to be filled as the “silver tsunami” begins to make an impact. They would also like to identify retirement-ready employees who qualify to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees.

Table 1 will contain the number of current employees who are about to retire, grouped by job title.
Table 2 will list those employees from Table 1 who are eligible for the mentorship program.
Now, let’s take a closer look at how to create these tables.
